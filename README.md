# EutherWire

EutherWire is a WaylandForge-native drawing and planning tool for electrical,
network, conduit, cable, and home-technology installations.

The project deliberately starts smaller than a general CAD system. Its first
real document is a garage installation with a distribution board, PoE switch,
conduits, cameras, and cable routes. Objects and connections are structured
data rather than unrelated pixels and lines.

## Bootstrap

WaylandForge is pinned as a Git submodule:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NichlasEk/EutherWire.git
```

For an existing clone:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Status

The repository has entered checkpoint 1: architecture is fixed and the
headless document kernel is being built. See
[docs/development-plan.md](docs/development-plan.md).

## Product principles

- One document model feeds both physical plan and logical schematic views.
- Devices have typed ports; cables connect ports.
- Conduits and cables are separate objects.
- Stable object IDs and a versioned, diff-friendly project format exist from
  the first release.
- Editing is command-based so undo and redo are fundamental, not retrofits.
- Document coordinates never depend on pixels or the current viewport.
- Deterministic rendering and export make projects testable.
